            <div >
                <p>
                    We are a warm and friendly society that aims to bring together
                    the Malaysian community through social and cultural events.
                    We aim to promote a home away from home, because we believe that
                    <i>home is not a place, its a feeling</i>. In effort of promoting Malaysia's
                    rich multicultural heritage, we sincerely welcome everyone who is 
                    interested in Malaysia's culture to join our family!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we would like to extend a warm welcome and Salam Sejahtera to 
                    all of you. This is the official website for Queen Mary Malaysian Society 
                    (QMMS). It serves as a platform for anyone who wants to be updated with our 
                    current events. We would regularly update this page, with upcoming news and 
                    also any past events that we have successfully organised. This way, any external
                    parties that wish to be connected or stay in touch with QMMS can easily do so 
                    with our website. QMMS contacts, the current committee, our sponsors
                    and our ongoing activities will be available here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last but not least, we wish that our website can be a storehouse with the cherished 
                    memories of each and every one of our members, regardless if you are a current student 
                    or an alumni of Queen Mary, University of London. Hopefully, every single one of you 
                    can use this website as a place to reminisce your fun, joyous and sweet experiences 
                    even after years to come.
